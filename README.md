Thermoelectric semiconductor simulation

Thermoelectric semiconductors are functional materials that can directly convert heat and electrical energy. Thermoelectric semiconductor simulation uses computer simulation technology to simulate and analyze the properties and working processes of thermoelectric semiconductor materials. Through simulation, the thermoelectric effects of thermoelectric semiconductors under different conditions (such as temperature, electric field, magnetic field, etc.) can be studied, including the Seebeck effect (converting heat energy into electrical energy), the Peltier effect (the reversible conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy), and the Thomson effect. It can also predict the thermoelectric performance parameters of materials, such as the thermoelectric merit value (ZT value, an important indicator to measure the performance of thermoelectric materials), which is helpful to optimize the design and preparation process of thermoelectric semiconductor materials and develop high-performance thermoelectric conversion devices, which have important applications in power generation, refrigeration and other fields.
